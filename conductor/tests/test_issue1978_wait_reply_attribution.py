"""Issue #1978 / PR #2273 round 2: the bridge's wait path must return the reply
that ``session send --wait -q`` bound to THIS message.

``--wait -q`` prints exactly the turn-bound reply on stdout (the CLI binds it
to the transcript record of the submitted prompt). The bridge used to discard
that stdout and re-fetch ``session output``, i.e. whatever the LATEST reply in
the transcript was at that moment — which reopens the attribution race the
turn binding exists to close: a turn that started after ours, or a queued
message from another sender, could be handed back as our reply.
